this amuses me its a c# conole that calls the C++ exe to display c++ output!
doing this without a dll ...
but c++ should probably be the main Project and C# as the reference project but it kinda works already without adding any extra
just test layout for c++ FrontEnd GPU C# backend CPU
the reference to C++ conole app is a warning though but why im not sure
